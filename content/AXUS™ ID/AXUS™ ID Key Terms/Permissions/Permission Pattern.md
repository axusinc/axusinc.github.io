**Permission pattern** is specified as a [Regular Expression (RegEx)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) `string` so here the magic comes: you can just write some [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)for similar permissions. **Wikipedia** page of [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular\_expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

> [!example]
> To grant all permissions that start with `abc` in one [[Full Permission Pattern]], you can just write the next **RegEx** as [[Permission Pattern]]: `^abc`.
