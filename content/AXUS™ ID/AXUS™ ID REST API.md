One of ways to interact with the [[AXUS™ ID]] system is traditional **REST API**. See [[#OpenAPI]] section to get **REST API** specification with all supported  methods and information about them.
## OpenAPI
Download our [OpenAPI Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification) here: [[AXUS™ ID OpenAPI Specification.yaml]].

You can view it easily, for example, in [Swagger Editor Next](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) by importing the specification via the **URL** below or the `.yaml` file attached above.

Direct link to [OpenAPI Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification): `https://axusinc.github.io/AXUS%E2%84%A2-ID/AXUS%E2%84%A2-ID-OpenAPI-Specification.yaml`

> [!warning]
> Please note that all posible fields were specified in the responses in [OpenAPI Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification). So even if an example method response in [OpenAPI Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification) has both `error` and `data` fields specified, that, of course, doesn't means that the method can **fail successfully** :) As much as possible fields where included in examples to show all aspects of possible responses.
